        <p> The box model describes the physical properties of each element on your page. Margin, borders, padding, and content all make up an element's box. In this case, the inner div's tags margins can be seen with the blue color, the border is black, the padding is represented by orange and the element's width and height are yellow.</p>
            
            <p>When margins touch each other on the top or bottom of two elements, they will collapse or overlap. if they are two different sizes, it will take the largest value. if you dont want them to collapse, you have to do something in order to make them not touch. Adding a border is a possible solution.  </p>
